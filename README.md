Clustering-algorithms:

Two algorithms, K-means and Fuzzy-C means have been implemented. The algorithms are run on a BSOM dataset, which is a private dataset. Hence, it cannot be uploaded for public. These algorithms are implemented for cluster ranges 2 to 10, to evaluate what is the best cluster value. The evaluation of clusters are done using Davies Bouldin Index metric.
All these have been implemented from scratch without any in-built methods. The graphs have also been plotted.
